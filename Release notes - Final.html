                                <p>CT Lung Lobe Density Analysis is a new application/preset that leverages deep learning technology, extending the Lung Density Analysis application to measure HU density and volume in the various lung lobes. It segments the right lung into upper, middle, and lower lobes and the left lung into upper and lower lobes, assigning HU density, percentile, and volume measurements to each. The lobular level breakdown delivers precise measurements and reporting of density and volume for a more informative lung density analysis workflow.</p>

It streamlines and accelerates the TAVR planning workflow, while also helping reduce the variability among users with different experience levels. Includes configurable display names in the Algorithm Processing Tab.</p>

                <p>Please review the following important considerations before deploying or using this release.</p>
                <div class="note">
                    <h3>Mirada NMX Availability (7.16.2, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>The Mirada NMX application is no longer available in the EU for new customers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="note">
                    <h3>Large Dataset Processing (7.16.0, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>Vitrea may not be able to process large (with regard to matrix size and/or number of slices) datasets in some circumstances. Contact your system administrator or Canon Customer Support for more information.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="note">
                    <h3>Auto MPR Operation Manual Updates (7.15.8, 7.16.0, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>For the Operation Manual for Auto MPR, the following updates should have been included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On page 14, change the series description from "Brain Scan" to "Head Scan".</li>
                        <li>On page 18, update the "Terminating the application" subsection to 4.2.5.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="note">
                    <h3>.NET 6.0 Runtimes (7.15.7, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>.NET 6.0 runtimes for .NET, ASP.NET Core, and .NET Desktop are installed automatically by the InstallVitrea.exe file as a part of the software installation process. These runtimes should be updated regularly with up-to-date security patches and bug fixes. Contact Canon Customer Support for more information about updating .NET runtimes. While .NET 6.0 is a Microsoft product, it is distinct from .NET Framework 4.8. .NET Framework 4.8 is a component of the Windows Operating System whereas .NET 6.0 is an independent product. These products have different support policies. Contact Canon Customer Support for more details.</p>

                    <h3>Multi Modality Viewer Measurement Units (7.15.7, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>In the Multi Modality Viewer Education and Reference Guide, the following NOTE belongs in the "Understanding Measurement Values and Units" section:</p>
                    <p>For a DX image to show "mm", it needs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tag (0018,1164) ImagerPixelSpacing</li>
                        <li>Tag (0018,1114) EstimatedRadiographicMagnificationFactor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This will show "mm ERMF" or:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tag (0028,0030) PixelSpacing</li>
                        <li>SOP class UID of "X-Ray 3D Angiographic Image Storage" - 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.13.1.1</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This will show "mm".</p>
                    <p>The dataset in question has no EstimatedRadiographicMagnificationFactor tag, so it cannot show "mm ERMF". And the SOP class UID is "Digital X-Ray Image Storage - For Presentation", so it cannot show "mm". Thus it falls back to "pixels".</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <h3>Windows Operating System Support (All Versions, All Deployments)</h3>
                    <p>Canon Medical strongly recommends that Vitrea AV software be installed on currently Microsoft-supported Windows Operating Systems. We can not guarantee that the Vitrea AV Workstation or Vitrea AV clients for multi-user systems like Extend and Enterprise will continue to function properly on Windows Operating Systems that Microsoft no longer supports. Contact Canon Medical Customer Support for more information.</p>
