                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Summit Medical Group decided imaging was a key component in improving healthcare and outcomes. They had to confront challenges with their wide base of practitioners, vast specialties, multiple facilities, dynamic needs and supporting infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Their existing PACS viewer presented issues: confusing tools, clunky interfaces, multiple client versions, deployment issues and dataflow constraints. Even with web access, users had to learn different interfaces for each facility and couldn't compare exams from different facilities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why Canon Medical?</strong> After evaluating several universal viewer products, Vitrea® View enterprise viewer rose to the top. It provided the right depth of tools, user-centric experience and design, while enabling Summit Medical Group to view almost any image type, from anywhere, on demand.</p>
                    
                    <div class="quote">
                        "This was our best experience with a product implementation, EVER! From planning, to delivery, to post project review, Canon Medical was on point and helped us every step of the way."
                        <br><strong>- Kathie Vendemia, Associate Director of Imaging</strong>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><strong>Success:</strong> The implementation was completed on time and on budget. With over 500 referring providers spread across 60+ locations, training was a concern. However, Vitrea View's ease-of-use made adoption simple with training materials and videos provided through email and intranet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Follow-up visits revealed no complaints about confusion using the viewer, and response has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> King Edward VII's Hospital had an aging PACS that was performing poorly. The hospital was challenged to provide uniform access to imaging in all service areas. When an upgrade was proposed by another vendor at high cost with no new functionality, leadership decided to consider other options.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why Canon Medical?</strong> Having had a positive business relationship with Canon Medical in the past, the hospital launched a tender process. After careful review, IT, medical and administrative staff all selected Canon Medical.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Success:</strong> The hospital outlined requirements that included a timeline for project completion within three months. They set up a dedicated team of clinical and IT resources to direct the implementation of the Vitrea® Enterprise Imaging solution.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) was interested in providing a consistent view of patient information across the enterprise. They were rolling out a new EMR from Epic and wanted to provide enterprise access to patient imaging history directly from the EMR system.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prior to implementation, clinicians had limited access to imaging studies. They could only view images stored in local PACS and had to learn multiple PACS client interfaces. IT was challenged to provide convenient, secure access across all locations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why Canon Medical?</strong> JHM selected and implemented Vitrea® Enterprise Viewer in phase one of their enterprise viewer initiative. Clinicians can view patient images, radiology reports and related documents from within the EMR via a secure link that integrates with JHM's single sign-on mechanism.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Success:</strong> Phase two extended this capability by implementing Vitrea Data Stream technology to provide direct access to studies stored in PACS at Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital and Sibley Memorial Hospital facilities without requiring data migration, routing, or caching.</p>
