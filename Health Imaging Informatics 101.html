                        <p>An EMR contains the electronic record of health-related information on an individual. The overall goal of an EMR is to eventually rid practices of using paper medical records.</p>
                        <p>Not only is the EMR used to document patient care, but the record is also used for financial and legal information, as well as research and quality improvement purposes.</p>

                        <p>It would accomplish this by gathering data from many sources and making information accessible online to users with the necessary credentials.</p>

                        <p>A typical PACS network is comprised of a central server that stores a database containing images connected to one or more clients.</p>

                        <p>Today RIS capabilities are often provided by PACS and/or EMR vendors.</p>

                        <p>A universal viewer provides general medical image and document access across a diverse medical enterprise environment. Typically launched from EMR, universal viewers connect to multiple data sources to gather and present a consolidated view of a patient.</p>
                        <p>Because the users are so diverse, the functionality of a universal viewer is kept very simple – aimed towards quick information review in context with an exam report.</p>

                        <p>Server virtualization transparently divides a computer into multiple "virtual" computers. This allows IT to break free from the "one application, one server" rule.</p>

                <h3>Health Information Technology (HIT)</h3>
                <p>HIT is a general term encompassing the management of health information through networked computerized systems enabling secure exchange between consumers, providers, government and quality entities, and insurers.</p>
                <p>HIT is increasingly viewed as the most promising tool for improving the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the health delivery system. Broad and consistent utilization of HIT will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve health care quality</li>
                    <li>Prevent medical errors</li>
                    <li>Reduce health care costs</li>
                    <li>Increase administrative efficiencies</li>
                    <li>Decrease paperwork</li>
                    <li>Expand access to affordable care</li>

            </div>
            
            <div class="card" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                <h3>Health Imaging Informatics (HII)</h3>
                <p>Also known as Radiology Informatics or Medical Imaging Informatics, is a subspecialty of Biomedical Informatics that aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, usability and reliability of medical imaging services within the healthcare enterprise.</p>
                <p>This discipline is devoted to the study of how information about and contained within medical images is retrieved, analyzed, enhanced, and exchanged throughout the medical enterprise.</p>

                    <li>Introduce the personas most typically associated with HIT and HII and the tools they use on a daily basis</li>
                    <li>Identify and define terms and systems frequently used with HIT and HII and tie back to user personas where appropriate</li>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>DICOM</h3>
                    <p>Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine is the primary standard used in medical imaging. It is designed to ensure the interoperability of various systems by standardizing the way digital imaging is stored, printed, handled and transmitted.</p>
                    <p>The DICOM standard, initially named "ACR/NEMA 300", was first developed in 1985. It was renamed DICOM in 1993 with version 3.0.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
                    <p>Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand, like the electricity grid.</p>
                    <p>NIST Key characteristics of cloud: On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, location independence, rapid elasticity, and measured service.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Virtualization</h3>
                    <p>Allows a physical resource to appear as one or more logical resources. This can apply to any type of computing resource, e.g. storage, but most often refers to server virtualization.</p>
                    <p>Server virtualization transparently divides a computer into multiple "virtual" computers. This allows IT to break free from the "one application, one server" rule.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Universal Viewer</h3>
                    <p>Provides general medical image and document access across a diverse medical enterprise environment. Typically launched from EMR, universal viewers connect to multiple data sources to gather and present a consolidated view of a patient.</p>
                    <p>Because the users are so diverse, the functionality of a universal viewer is kept very simple – aimed towards quick information review in context with an exam report.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Context Launching</h3>
                    <p>Refers to the integration between two applications such that the context is passed from the launching application (such as a PACS) to the launched application (such as Vitrea).</p>
                    <p>Context typically includes user name, patient demographics and study identifiers. This saves users time so they don't have to log in to the launched application and search for the patient/study.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Software Rendering</h3>
                    <p>Advanced computer graphics applications, such as 3D medical imaging, traditionally require a powerful graphics card (GPU). Recent improvements in CPU processing power make it possible for applications to handle advanced graphics processing without a GPU.</p>
                    <p>This CPU-based rendering is also referred to as software rendering.</p>
